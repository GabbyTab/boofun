# Code of Conduct

## Principles

We engage as peers—capable adults who can disagree, be wrong, and learn.

### Intellectual Standards

- **Precision over politeness theater.** Be clear. Say what you mean.
- **Good faith.** Assume others are trying to help or understand.
- **Openness to being wrong.** If you're shown to be incorrect, update. Expect the same from others.
- **Epistemic humility.** Distinguish what we know from what we assume. Acknowledge uncertainty.
- **Direct criticism is welcome.** "This is wrong because X" is helpful. Personal attacks are not.

### Behavior

**Do:**
- Point out errors directly
- Ask clarifying questions
- Disagree with reasoning, not people
- Accept corrections gracefully

**Don't:**
- Harass or demean
- Make it personal
- Act in bad faith
- Waste others' time with noise

## Scope

Applies to all project spaces: issues, PRs, discussions, and related channels.

## Enforcement

Violations can be reported by opening an issue or contacting the maintainer. I'll handle it.
